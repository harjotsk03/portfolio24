              that helps students easily find ideal study spots, whether nearby
              or anywhere around the world. The inspiration came from a common

              study with the right amenities like{" "}

                Problem

              <br></br>
              Before starting this project, I faced the challenge of not having
              built a fully{" "}
              <span className="poppins-semibold text-white">
                hosted full-stack application{" "}
              </span>{" "}
              accessible to real users. This made developing both the front-end
              and back-end from scratch a new experience for me. Additionally, I
              recognized a common issue that students frequently encounter: the
              question of{" "}
              <span className="poppins-semibold text-white">
                "where should we study today?"{" "}
              </span>{" "}
              Students often struggle to find study spots that meet their
              needsâ€”whether it's having access to Wi-Fi, power outlets, or a
              quiet environment to focus.
            </p>

                Solution
              </span>
              <br></br>
              To address this, I created Study Spotr, an application that allows
              students to easily find the perfect study location nearby or{" "}
              <span className="poppins-semibold text-white">
                anywhere in the world{" "}
              </span>
              . This platform solves the problem by providing detailed
              information about study spots, including amenities like{" "}
              <span className="poppins-semibold text-white">
                Wi-Fi, outlets, quiet spaces, and more{" "}
              </span>
              . With the ability to{" "}
              <span className="poppins-semibold text-white">
                rate and review locations, students can make informed decisions
                about where to study{" "}
              </span>
              , saving time and avoiding frustration. Built with the MERN stack
              (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and integrated with
              the Google Maps API, Study Spotr provides a seamless user
              experience, offering multiple ways to discover and explore ideal
              study environments.

                      Additionally, creating clusters was challenging and didnâ€™t
                      work as expected. Lastly, there was no option to allow

                      new API made it significantly easier to implement features
                      such as clusters, custom pins, and dynamic pin changes on

                  While developing my study finder app using the MERN stack with

                  avoid security vulnerabilities. Another challenge was dealing
                  with cross-origin resource sharing{" "}

                  . I ran into a few CORS errors when trying to authenticate
                  users or send data between the two platforms, which took some
                  troubleshooting to resolve. Configuring environment variables
                  and secrets, like JWT keys, across Vercel and Render also
                  proved to be tricky at times, leading to some inconsistent

                  token refreshing to keep users logged in securely, without
                  forcing them to constantly re-authenticate, was another
                  hurdle, especially when considering users switching between

                  Building this application has been a highly rewarding
                  experience, providing me with valuable insights into{" "}

                  and the intricacies of modern web applications. One major
                  takeaway was the importance of securely managing user
                  authentication, particularly how to properly store and handle
                  tokens and cookies to ensure both security and seamless user
                  experiences. I also learned how to effectively troubleshoot{" "}
                  <span className="text-white poppins-medium">CORS issues</span>
                  , which often come up when working with separate frontend and
                  backend deployments, especially when theyâ€™re hosted on
                  different platforms like{" "}
                  <span className="text-white poppins-medium">Vercel</span> and{" "}
                  <span className="text-white poppins-medium">Render</span>.
                  Deploying the app across these platforms taught me the
                  significance of configuring{" "}

                    environment variables

                  correctly and ensuring smooth integration between services. I
                  gained a deeper understanding of how to manage{" "}

                  maintaining a live application. Overall, this project enhanced
                  my technical skills and reinforced the importance of planning
