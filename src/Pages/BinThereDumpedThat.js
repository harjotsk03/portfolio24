              encountered the challenge of addressing the{" "}

                incorrect disposal of items
              </span>{" "}

              from bins being emptied when it wasnâ€™t necessary. We saw that
              students and users were often confused about how to properly sort
              their waste, leading to contamination between{" "}
              <span className="poppins-semibold text-white">
                recycling, compost, and general waste
              </span>
              . Additionally, janitorial staff were spending time emptying bins
              that were not full, causing inefficiency and unnecessary use of
              resources. Our challenge was to create a system that could solve
              both problems efficiently.

                      Prioritizing a mobile-first approach for "Bin There,
                      Dumped That" was crucial given that our users, including
                      janitors and facility managers, interact with the system
                      in public spaces while on the move. A mobile-responsive

                      information efficiently while standing or walking. This
                      design supports quick decision-making, allowing them to

                      <br></br>Additionally, the mobile application can leverage

                      that require servicing, thereby enhancing operational
                      efficiency. By facilitating instant communication among
                      team members and allowing for quick data entry and
                      feedback, we promote better coordination and a proactive
                      approach to waste management. Overall, this user-centered
                      design not only improves usability but also fosters higher

                      To prevent information overload, we implemented a concise,
                      non-intrusive alert system tailored for janitors. By
                      presenting alerts regarding full or nearly full bins in a
                      clean dashboard view, we minimized distractions and
                      streamlined their workflow, allowing them to focus solely

                      We opted to integrate Arduino for our hardware components
                      due to its accessibility and versatility in managing
                      various sensors. This decision significantly simplified
                      the calibration of ultrasonic sensors, enabling precise
                      measurements of bin fullness and efficient tracking of
                      locations. Arduino's user-friendly interface and extensive
                      community support facilitated a straightforward hardware
                      setup, allowing our team to focus on developing the
                      software side of the project without getting bogged down
                      in complex hardware configurations. Additionally, its
                      compatibility with numerous sensors meant we could easily
                      adapt our design as needed, ensuring that our solution
                      remained scalable and adaptable to future enhancements.

                      We chose to utilize TensorFlow for image recognition to
                      effectively differentiate between various types of waste.
                      This decision was pivotal, as it allowed us to leverage
                      pre-trained models, which significantly accelerated the
                      classification process while ensuring accuracy in
                      identifying items for disposal. By building on established
                      models, we reduced the time and resources required to
                      develop and train a new model from scratch, allowing us to
                      focus our efforts on fine-tuning and optimizing the
                      solution for our specific needs. This approach not only
                      streamlined the development process but also enhanced the
                      system's overall reliability, as TensorFlowâ€™s robust
                      framework is widely recognized for its performance in
                      real-world applications. As a result, our system became
                      more efficient in guiding users towards the correct waste
                      disposal options, promoting responsible waste management
                      and minimizing contamination in recycling streams.
